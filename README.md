# php_practice_project
a small login project of myself to show how well i now understand php

The project consist of  login page where one to access the index page he has to login first
Then The user if he is not registered he has to sign up and save their details to a database


This is how the system works 

I am making a chicken management system where admin can add in the stock and have sales people sale the staff through the web application

i have created a regitration page where if you dont have an account you wont be able to see information in the indec page you have to login first so instead when you try to open the index page you are redirected to the login page. if not you first register and it will redirect you to the login page to login

index page does not have much as its stil work in progress which i am going to make sure its fully working. thanks to this challenge this is really intresting and would like to further develop it.
